Welcome to the Node.JS application shell script repo for The Iron Yard - Indianapolis' Cohort 7!!!

There are some quick and simple steps to take in order to correctly use the script.


1.) I would first suggest forking this repository so you can have it and customize it anyway that you like.

2.) Get into a folder that can easily be accessed. This is where you will 'git clone' the repository.

3.) After you have cloned the repo into the folder, 'cd' into the folder you would like to put your application in.

4.) Once inside the folder, you can now run the shell script. In order to run the shell script, you will have to call the file from the folder that its in to run it. For example. If the route to get to your file is '~/TIY/application-boilerplate/application.sh', all you have to do is use that same path and call it with bash. So per the example, you would run the file with 'bash ~/TIY/application-boilerplate/application.sh'.

5.) I inserted and 'atom .' command in the application.sh file in order to open the project in Atom, and to see the layout of your project.

I hope that this will help you on your way to making tons of kick-ass projects!!! Star it if you like it :-)
